README

1. The data for the experiments to find the numerical constant is indcluded in a pdf called 'Problem 1 Open Hash.pdf' as well as the analysis of the information to find the constant. 

2. To run problem 2: Dictionary - Closed Hash, use the target closedhash through the command

	make closedhash

There is a PDF titled Problem 2 Closed Hash with table and test data for problem 2.

5. The adjacency matrixes are made using 2D arrays.
-1 represents there there is no connection between 2 nodes.
The Dijsktra function requires the matrix, the source vertex, and the number of vertices.

7. To run problem 7: Floyd's algorithm, use the target floyd through the command 
	
	make floyd
