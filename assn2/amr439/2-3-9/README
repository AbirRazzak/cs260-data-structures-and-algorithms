Problem 1: PointerQueue

Run the make file for this, and you can see all the functions being tested.

Problems 2 and 3 : Tree ADT and Timings

Timing will create a tree of degree 3 with height 3 and a tree with height 4
The trees are as follows:

Tree of height 3:
         
          1
  2       3       4
3 4 5   4 5 6   5 6 7


Tree of height 4:

Same as height of 3 but with the following children in row 4:

3: 3 4 5
4: 5 6 7
5: 6 7 8

4: 5 6 7
5: 6 7 8
6: 7 8 9

5: 6 7 8
6: 7 8 9
7: 8 9 10

Problem 4: MergeLists
Merges the 2 lists with size n.

Problem 8: Post and Pre Orders
Run with Command Line Arguements

Problem 9: Huffman

Only difference here is that I stored the running total in the empty nodes instead of removing that value. It doesn't affect the binary numbers, just something to consider if you're debugging.
